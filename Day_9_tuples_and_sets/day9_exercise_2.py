# 2. Common Elements



# Write a function that returns a tuple with common elements in three sequences. Inputs can be list, tuple, string.

# get_common_elements(seq1, seq2, seq3)

# Example:

# get_common_elements("abc", ['a', 'b'], ('b', 'c')) -> ('b',) # we return a tuple with a single element 

# # remember that we can convert strings to set with set(mystring), and set to tuple with tuple(myset)

# 2. b For those with some experience 

# BONUS:  make a function that can handle an arbitrary number of input sequences
# so function which takes any number of sequences and returns a tuple with common elements
# get_common_elements(seq1, seq2, seq3, seq4, seq5, seq6, seq7) etc :), so just like print takes any number of values
