# # # # # # # # # # # Python Dictionaries
# # # # # # # # # # # https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
# # # # # # # # # # # key - value pairs
# # # # # # # # # # # unordered
# # # # # # # # # # # other languages - associative array, map, hashmap
# # # # # # # # # # # O(1) value lookup - very quick even for large dictionaries
# # # # # # # # mutable - can be changed
# # # # # # # # dynamic can grow or shrink in size
# # # # # ### iterable can loop through (order from 3.6+ is in order of insertion)
# # # # # # # # can be nested - matroyshka principle
# # # # # # # # from Python 3.6 dictionaries preserve insertion order
# # #
# empty_dict = {}  # another way is with dict() compare with list which is []
# another_empty_dict = dict()
# # # # # avoid calling your variable dict  because dict is used as builtin function
# # best dictionary name would actually explain what it stores
# # for example - phonebook, user_info, etc.
# # # #
# print(empty_dict)
# print(another_empty_dict)
# # # #
# print(len(empty_dict))

# # we can create a dictionary with some values
# tel = {'valdis': 2640, 'līga': 2911}  # create dict with 2 key-value pairs

# # # adding new key-value pair
# tel['maija'] = 2653  # i add a new key-value pair to the dictionary or overwrite the old one
# print(tel)
# # # print(type(tel))
# # # #
# # # # # # this is why we use dictionaries very fast to look up
# print(tel['valdis'])  # this lookup will be very fast O(1) even with huge dictionary
# # # #
# key = "maija"  # variable key could be named anything
# print(tel[key])  # get value by key

# # # # values can be changed
# tel['valdis'] = 1188  # keys have to be unique, so here I will overwrite my old value
# print(tel)
# # # # # if I have many phones well, then I have options, how about a list?
# tel['valdis'] = [2640, 1188, 911]  # setting value to a list

# print(tel)
# # # # # # # # # # # # keys are unique, values can match for different keys
