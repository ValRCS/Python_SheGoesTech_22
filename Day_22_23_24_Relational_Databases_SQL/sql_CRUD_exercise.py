# TODO: the following 5 functions for CRUD(create, read,update,delete) operations that work with sqlite database called chinook.db

# def create_connection(dbpath):
#   # can add verbose parameter that prints sqlite version used
#   return conn
# def create_artist(conn, artist_name):
   # use parametrized query !
#   # do not have to return anything but can use try: inside this function
# def read_artists(conn):  # can add some extra parameters to limit
#   return artists  # can return a list of tuples, or you can create a list of artist objects if you want
# def update_artist(id, new_name):
# def delete_artist(id=None, name=""):
#    # provide deletion by id AND/OR name


# test it by adding you name to artists table smile

# you can use .ipynb or .py file
