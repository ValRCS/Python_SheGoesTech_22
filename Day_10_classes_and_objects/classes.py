# # OOP - Object Oriented Programming
# # OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects
# #  and their interactions to design and program applications.
# # Classes and Objects
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Python Class
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Classes -> combine related data(properties)
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Classes -> combine related functionality(methods)
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Classes: blueprints
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Objects - instances of class

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # Objects: concrete realization of those blueprints
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
# # # #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # how to store and process data about garage
# # # # # # # # # # # my_garage = ["paint can", "old papers", "rotting potatoes"]
# # # # # # # # # # # my_garage_d = {"paints": ["white", "black"], "food": "potatoes"}
# # # # # then i want to write some functions on how to deal with this garage
# # # # # OOP lets us combine values/properties and functions/methods in a single entity
# # # #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # empty class definition
# # # # # # # # # #
# # # #
# class EmptyClass:  # EmptyClass is just a name I made up, Classes start with Capital letter
#     pass  # pass is empty instruction


# # #
# # #
# # # #
# # # #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # i create an  based on class blueprint
# # # #
# # empty_class_instance_object = EmptyClass()  # creating an object
# # print(type(empty_class_instance_object))
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # not great OOP style but i can add to an existing object
# # empty_class_instance_object.paint = ["red", "blue"] # i can add arbitrary properties
# # empty_class_instance_object.papers = ["Diena"]
# # empty_class_instance_object.owner = "Valdis"
# # print(empty_class_instance_object.paint)
# # # # # # #
# # # # empty_class_instance_object.my_value = 55
# # # # print(empty_class_instance_object.my_value)
# # # # # so I can store data in an object
# # # # # but we are not utilizing blueprints/templates
# # # # # # # # # # # # # empty_class_instance_object
# # empty_2 = EmptyClass() # so different object based on same EmptyClass
# # empty_2.painter = "Picasso"
