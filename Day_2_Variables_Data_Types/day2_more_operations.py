# Python built in functions
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

# you should not name your variables the same as built in functions
# round = 0  # generally do not not do this! this is a bad idea
# print(round) # now round is not a function anymore but a variable

# Python list reserved keywords
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
# so these are reserved words and you CAN NOT use them as variable names
# class = 5 # will not work

# Python built in constants
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html
# so these are reserved words and you CAN NOT use them as variable names

print(len("Valdis")) # this is a function that returns the length of a string - 6
# print(len(5)) # this will not work
number = -6.7
print(number, abs(number)) # this is a function that returns the absolute value of a number - 6.7

help(print) # this is a function that returns the help for a function print
# help was more useful when IDEs were not so good :)

# whew that was a lot of information
