# first lets make a string with some phone numbers from various countries

phone_text = """
+1 555 123 4567
+1 555 123 456
+1 555 123 45
Latvia +371 20 123 456

Lithuania +370 5 123 456

Estonia +372 5123 456

USA +1 408 123 4567

sometimes we write our phone numbers like this: 555 123 4560

sometimes we write our phone numbers like this: 555-123-4561

sometimes we write our phone numbers like this: 555.123.4562 rarely
also we use parentheses: (555) 123-4563

so the assignment is to write a regular expression that will match all of these phone numbers
"""

# TODO get all of these phone numbers using a regular expression
# and return them as a list
# see how many you can get
# of course you can google for some regex ideas but first see how far you can get on your own
