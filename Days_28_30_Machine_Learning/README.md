# ML introduction


## What exactly is machine learning?

### Short definition
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

from Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning (2Million students!! but prepare for MATLAB/OCTAVE ughh)

### Dry definition from SAS
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## AI vs ML

Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.

Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.

## ML as related to

* Statistics - statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.
* Data Mining - knowledge discovery using similar/same methods as Machine Learning
