import string  # this has some extra string constants not required usually
# #
# what is a string really ?
# a string is a sequence of characters
# a string is a sequence of bytes - in older versions of python
# a string is a sequence of unicode characters
# a string is a sequence of unicode code points
# a string is a sequence of unicode code units
# a unicode could be 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes actually - depending on the character
# latin characters are 1 byte
# latvian characters are 2 bytes
# lithuanian characters are 2 bytes - not sure :)
# chinese characters are 2 bytes  - not 100% sure
# japanese characters are 3 bytes - not 100% sure
# arabic characters are 4 bytes
# emoji are 4 bytes - due to UTF-8 encoding

print(ord('≈°'))
lithuanian_chars = "ƒÖƒçƒôƒóƒØ≈°≈≥≈´≈æ"
for c in lithuanian_chars:
    print(c, ord(c))

# 2 bytes that means max value is 65535
# 3 bytes that means max value is 16777215
print(2**16, 2**24) # so 24 bit color is 16 million colors
# if 16 million colors is not enough - then use 32 bit color
# then if 16 million characters is enough why does UTF-8 use 4 bytes ?
# because UTF-8 is a variable length encoding, but that is not a full answer
