# TODO
# Create a new Jupyter Notebook
# top cell should be a markdown cell with headline and your name
# optional insert a hotlink to some nice picture

# rest will be code cells
# create a new code cell and write a function that prints "Hello Notebooks!"
# create a code cell for all imports that you need
# create a code cell for all variables that you need
# create a code cell for all functions that you need - optional
# create a code cell for all classes that you need - optional
# above could also be a single cell with all imports, variables, functions and classes

# have a cell that runs your previous homework from day 14
# ideally you would see a graph in the notebook

# if you do not have last homework
# enter any other homework from previous days
# theoretically you could also enter everything in a single cell
# but it is better to have a cell for each sub-task
