# 1a. Average value

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers (float).


# The program shows the average value of all entered numbers after each entry.
# PS. 1a can do without a list

# 1b. The program shows both the average value of the numbers and ALL the numbers entered

# PS Exit the program  by entering "q"

# 1c The program does not show all the numbers entered but only TOP3 and BOTTOM3 and of course still average.
