# # # #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # we can give our functions parameters and those parameters take arguments
# # # #
# # what is a function?
# # a function is a block of code that is designed to do one specific job
# # the above is a platonic ideal of a function - not always true

# # print("Go eat")
# # print("Let's order food")
# # # #
# # print("maybe i do something else")
# # # more code follows
# # print("Go eat")
# # print("Let's order food")
# # print("Go eat")
# # print("Let's order food")
# # # #
# # # # # # # # # defining simple function
# def go_eat():
#     # function block starts here
#     print("Calling function go_eat")
#     print("Go eat fast food")
#     print("Let's order food RIGHT Now!")
#     print("Pay and Leave")
#     # we could add more stuff for our function here include loops, ifs etc


# # #
# # #
# # # #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # calling function
# # #
# # #
# # go_eat()
# # go_eat()
# # print("Do something else")
# # for _ in range(4): # if we do not need the loop variable we use _, all that we care about is the loop
# #     go_eat()
# # # # # # # # go_eat()
# # # #
# # # # order_food("No bueno")  # can't call before defining
# # #
# # #
# # # dish = "pizza"  # this is outer scope, nothing to do with order_food parameter


# # # # # # # # # # # # # requirement that order_food is given an argument
# def order_food(dish):  # dish is a parameter, can be called anything
#     dish = str(dish)  # because we will be using capitalize later on, this is not required most of the time
#     print(f"I am ordering {dish}")
#     print(f"{dish.capitalize()} should be pretty tasty")
#     # so local dish stops working here


# # #
# # #
# # # # # # # # # # no dish here
# # # #
# # # #
# # order_food("potatoes")
# # order_food("ice cream")
# # # #
# # my_soup = "Beet soup"
# # order_food(my_soup)
# # print("Done with soup for now")

# # # so print is a built in function
# # # https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
