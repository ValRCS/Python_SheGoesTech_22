# # # # # # # Extensive - Batteries Included - just import!
# # # # # # # Available across most OSes
# #
# # # # # # # 4 ways of importing modules
# import datetime
# print(datetime.datetime.now())
# print(datetime.datetime.today())
from datetime import datetime as dt  # datetime has datetime submodule!
# print(dt.now()) # we using renamed datetime as dt
# from datetime import datetime
# print(datetime.now()) # we are using the original datetime
# print(datetime.now().year)
import string # mostly useful constants
# print(string.ascii_letters)
# print(string.digits)
import math
# # # # # # # import math as mth # Python likes these short names but not for standard library!
# print(math.cos(3.1415926), math.sin(math.pi), math.pi)
# from math import floor # i could import floor alone but beware name collission
# print(floor(3.15)) # we could have used int here instead, TODO is there different between floor and int?
# # so floor will be different from int if we have a negative number
# print(floor(-3.15), int(-3.15)) # so floor rounds down and int rounds to nearest integer
# from math import factorial as fact # in math it is !
# print(fact(5)) # so 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
# from collections import Counter # so i only want Counter from collections package
from statistics import mean
from statistics import median
from statistics import mode
from statistics import pstdev
from statistics import stdev
# mylist = [1,2,3,10,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# print(mean(mylist), median(mylist), mode(mylist), pstdev(mylist), stdev(mylist)) # so pstdev is population standard deviation
import random
# random_list = [random.randint(1,100) for _ in range(10_000)] # so i am creating a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 100
# # print statistics of random_list
# print(mean(random_list), median(random_list), mode(random_list), pstdev(random_list), stdev(random_list))

import itertools
# permutations
# so permutations is a generator that will generate all possible permutations of a list
# my_permutations = list( itertools.permutations([1,2,3,4]))
# print(my_permutations)
# # combinations
# # so combinations is a generator that will generate all possible combinations of a list
# # so in combinations order does not matter
# # wiki for combinations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination
# my_combinations = list( itertools.combinations([1,2,3,4], 2))
# print(my_combinations)
# # product
# # so product is a generator that will generate all possible products of a list
# # so in product order does matter
# # wiki for product https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)
# my_products = list( itertools.product([1,2,3,4], "Val"))
# print(my_products) # should be 16 items

# all of the above you could write some loops and do  yourself but itertools is more efficient
