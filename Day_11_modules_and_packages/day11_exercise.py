# 1. The Shuffle

# write  a function get_shuffled_cards()

# Inside the function create  a 52-card list of tuples [("2", "diamonds ♦"), ("2", "hearts ♥"), ....., ("A", "spades ♠"), ("A", "clubs ♣")]

# The function returns a shuffled set of cards - the same list with tuples but shuffled!

# Find the correct method from built in random library.

# you can use a loop or use something from the library

# BONUS: Something can be useful from here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html



# 2. Deck - probably for homework, see how far you get

# write a class Deck with the following attributes(variables)

# available - contains list of card tuples that can be used

# spent - contains list of card tuples that have been used

# there should be following methods:

# constructor (__init__) method

# initializes available with full 52 card list of tuples

# initializes spent with empty list

# shuffle(self):

# # shuffles available cards - works just like 1st function but works on available

# get_cards(self, count=1):
# # gets some number(default 1) of cards from available 
# adds these cards to spent
# returns these cards

# # you can add other methods and/or attributes if you wish to Deck class


# 3. create a new deck in a different .py file from where Deck() is located, that means use import !
